# Grilling

Run a read-only alignment pass before implementation. Confirmation of the
result means the plan is understood; it does not authorize a push, publication,
remote operation, destructive action, credential change, or other
consequential step.

## Establish the decision tree

1. Read the relevant repository instructions, owning documentation, current
   state, and existing implementation before asking questions.
2. Separate facts the environment can answer from decisions the user owns.
   Investigate facts directly or delegate bounded read-only exploration; never
   ask the user to retrieve information available to the agent.
3. Map decisions by dependency. A decision enters the current frontier only
   when its prerequisites are settled.
4. Keep only choices that materially affect scope, behavior, architecture,
   interfaces, risk, evidence, validation, rollout, or recovery. Resolve normal
   implementation details using established project conventions.

## Work the frontier

Ask the whole current frontier in one round, then wait. Number each question,
offer a recommended answer, and state its relevant consequence. Use structured
choices when the alternatives are genuinely closed; otherwise allow a free-form
answer. A question that depends on an unsettled answer belongs to a later round.

After each response, update the tree, reconcile contradictions with earlier
answers, and ask the next frontier. Do not repeat settled questions unless new
evidence invalidates their premise.

Do not manufacture ambiguity. If inspection shows that the user has already
specified every material decision, skip directly to the decision record.

## Confirm the decision record

When the frontier is empty, present one concise record containing:

- settled decisions;
- scope and explicit non-goals;
- assumptions and supporting evidence;
- affected owners, repositories, interfaces, or artifacts;
- implementation sequence;
- verification and acceptance criteria;
- rollout and recovery where applicable;
- unresolved blockers.

Ask the user to confirm or correct that record. Do not begin implementation
until they confirm it. If they correct it, reopen the affected branches and
continue the interview.

Plan confirmation does not replace a repository's authorization workflow,
independent review, source verification, physics or numerical validation, or
human domain approval.
